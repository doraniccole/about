        <p class="text">After living in KY, FL, NY, IN, WA and UT as a girl, by my teen years, I left my family and friends for the dessert, loitered Seattle’s city streets, and went off the grid. I experienced my mother’s death by my mid-twenties. Life was transformed by a surprise child in my thirties. Married life and motherhood rocked my world. I eagerly earned my B.S. in Psychology focusing on Child Development and, have since, tirelessly volunteered and substituted in the elementary and middle school levels. Soon after my second son was born, I divorced and subsequently chose sole parenthood. I have enjoyed the privilege of parenting two fantastically kind, funny, strong, and resilient human beings! Bartending is my livlihood and I have served in the hospitality industry for years. With the current conditions surrounding the pandemic, more students and teachers are working and learning remotely, more bartenders and service industry personnel are forced to transform their careers- just as more people are turning to technology to order their food and household goods and navigate their lives from a distance. I am thrilled to embark upon a new journey toward better serving my children as well as my neighboring and global communities through web developing.</p>
