             After having lived in KY, FL, NY, IN, WA, OR, and UT as a girl, I left my family and friends for the dessert, loitered Seattle’s city streets, and went off the grid. I experienced my mother’s death by my mid-twenties. Then my existence was transformed by having a child in my thirties. Married life and motherhood rocked my world!  I have enjoyed the privilege of parenting two fantastically kind, funny, strong, and resilient human beings! I enjoy the outdoors immensely. With the current conditions surrounding the pandemic, more students and teachers are working and learning remotely, more bartenders and service industry personnel are forced to transform their careers- as more people are turning to technology for ordering food and household goods while navigating their lives from a distance. I am thrilled to embark upon a new journey toward better serving my children as well as my neighboring and global communities through web developing and singing while I may!.</p>
